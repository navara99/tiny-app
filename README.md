# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Main Features

This application allows users to create an account and store shortened URLs in their account. Information about each URL can be monitored in the analytics section.

Available analytics:

- date the url was created
- total number of clicks
- total number of unique clicks (by sending visitor cookie)
- a complete log of every click (including date, time and visitor id)

Security measures are also implemented to protect user information. 

Security Measures:

- hashing passwords (bcrypt)
- cookie encryption (cookie-session)
